-- Fix Foreign Key Constraint Issue
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, let's check what foreign key constraints exist

-- If the constraint name is wrong, drop it and recreate it
-- (Only run this if the constraint name is incorrect)

-- Drop the existing constraint (replace 'wrong_constraint_name' with actual name)
-- ALTER TABLE collections DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS collection_user_id_fkey;

-- Recreate the constraint with the correct name
-- ALTER TABLE collections ADD CONSTRAINT collections_user_id_fkey 
--     FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Verify the constraint was created correctly
